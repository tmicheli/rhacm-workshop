== Cluster Sets and RBACs
To create different groups of clusters, RHACM defines the concept of cluster sets, represented by the ClusterSet object. A cluster set labels all the clusters that belong to it with the cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset=managed_clusterset_name label. RHACM uses this label to identify the clusters that belong to the cluster set, enabling you to take action on all the member clusters at once.
